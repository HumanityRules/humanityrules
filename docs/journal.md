## 2025-12-28 - Created Simple Dashboard (Track 1 MVP App)

### Summary

Created `deployable_repos/simple_dashboard/` — a minimal Streamlit app to test the deployment pipeline.

### Files Created

```
simple_dashboard/
├── app.py                      # Streamlit dashboard with fake metrics
├── pyproject.toml              # For local dev with uv
├── requirements.txt            # For Dockerfile
├── Dockerfile                  # Uses uv for fast installs
├── README.md
└── .streamlit/
    ├── credentials.toml        # Skips email prompt
    └── config.toml             # Disables telemetry
```

### Streamlit First-Run Prompt Skip

Streamlit shows an email collection prompt on first run. To skip it, create `.streamlit/credentials.toml`:

```toml
[general]
email = ""
```

And `.streamlit/config.toml` to disable telemetry:

```toml
[browser]
gatherUsageStats = false

[server]
headless = true
```

### Local Development

```bash
cd deployable_repos/simple_dashboard
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

`uv run` automatically creates an isolated `.venv`, installs deps from `pyproject.toml`, and runs the app.

## 2025-12-28 - Strategic Direction: Dual-Track MVP Approach

### Summary

Defined the strategic approach for finding product market fit: build a simple deployment pipeline first, then incrementally add features toward deploying complex enterprise apps.

### The Problem

We had built solid infrastructure (auth, org management, AWS account connection) but zero core product functionality. The gap between "connected AWS account" and "deployed app" was undefined.

### The Decision: Dual-Track Approach

Rather than attempting to deploy a complex app immediately, we'll pursue two parallel tracks:

**Track 1: Simple Dashboard → Working Deployment**
- Create a minimal Streamlit app with no dependencies
- Build the core deployment pipeline: Build → ECR → Fargate → URL
- Prove the loop closes end-to-end
- Target: days, not weeks

**Track 2: Feature Roadmap → db_portal**
- Use `db_portal` (existing Phoenix/Elixir internal tool) as the north star
- Each milestone adds one capability that enterprise apps need
- Eventually deploy db_portal as proof of enterprise readiness

### Feature Milestones (Track 2)

| Milestone    | Feature                    | db_portal Requirement                            |
|--------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **M1**       | Basic deploy (Streamlit)   | N/A (foundation)                                 |
| **M2**       | Environment variables      | `RUN_SAMPLER`, `SSLCERT_MODE`, `LE_MODE`         |
| **M3**       | Secrets injection          | `secret_key_base`, `signing_salt`, `db_password` |
| **M4**       | Managed RDS/Aurora         | MySQL database dependency                        |
| **M5**       | Custom domain + TLS        | `dataengr.coursehero.io` with certs              |
| **M6**       | SSO integration            | Okta SAML                                        |
| **M7**       | Private VPC networking     | Aurora connectivity, no public internet          |
| **M8**       | Background workers         | Sampler scheduler process                        |

### Why This Approach

1. **Faster learning** — Get a working deployment in days, not weeks
2. **Avoid scope creep** — Don't get lost in db_portal-specific issues
3. **Incremental value** — Each milestone is independently demoable
4. **Clear north star** — db_portal keeps us honest about enterprise requirements

### Target Persona

Data Scientists / ML Engineers who can build apps but struggle with deployment. They represent:
- Maximum pain (deployment is mystical to them)
- Growing market (vibe coding trend)
- Simpler initial scope (stateless web UIs)
- Clear success metric ("I have a URL")

### Folder Structure

```
deployable_repos/
├── db_portal/           # Track 2 goal (complex Phoenix app)
└── simple_dashboard/    # Track 1 MVP (minimal Streamlit app)
```

### Next Steps

1. Create `simple_dashboard/` with Streamlit app + Dockerfile
2. Manually deploy to Fargate to understand the AWS plumbing
3. Automate the pipeline in DevOps Hero
4. Wire to UI: App model + "Deploy" button + status page

## 2025-12-28 - Fixed Dropdown Popover Width Issue

### Summary

Fixed a visual bug where the organization dropdown's options list was rendering full-width instead of matching the button width.

### The Problem

The `el-options` popover element was using `w-(--button-width)` to match the button width, but the `--button-width` CSS variable was never being set by the Tailwind Plus Elements library. Since popover elements render in the browser's "top layer" (outside normal document flow), they don't inherit width from parent containers.

### The Fix

Added CSS Anchor Positioning rules in `styles.css`:

```css
el-select {
  anchor-name: --select-anchor;
}

el-options[popover] {
  position-anchor: --select-anchor;
  width: 15rem;                /* fallback for older browsers */
  width: anchor-size(width);   /* uses anchor's width in modern browsers */
}
```

Also removed the broken `w-(--button-width)` class from `_dropdown_select.html` since the width is now handled via CSS.

### Why This Approach

- **CSS Anchor Positioning** is the modern way to link a popover's dimensions to its anchor element
- The **fallback width** (`15rem`) ensures reasonable behavior in browsers without full anchor positioning support
- By moving this to CSS rather than relying on the Tailwind Plus Elements library to set a CSS variable, we have direct control over the behavior

## 2025-12-27 (evening) - Real User/Org Context & Organization Switcher

### Summary

Replaced all hardcoded fake data in the app shell with real user and organization data from the database. Added working organization switcher.

### Changes

- **`get_app_shell_context()`**: Now takes `request` param and pulls real data (user name, email, initials, organizations)
- **Organization switcher**: Dropdown in sidebar now actually switches organizations via `/switch-organization/` endpoint
- **`current_organization` on User model**: Moved from session storage to a FK on User. Made it NOT NULL with `on_delete=PROTECT`
- **Removed avatar**: Replaced profile image with user initials in colored circle
- **Removed `get_current_organization()`**: Was just `return request.user.current_organization`

### Migrations

- `0005_add_current_organization_to_user.py`
- `0006_make_current_organization_required.py` (data migration + NOT NULL)

## 2025-12-27 - Backend Callback Endpoint & Infrastructure Refinements

### Summary

Completed the AWS account connection flow by implementing the backend API endpoint that receives callbacks from the Lambda. Also standardized naming conventions and improved Lambda logging.

### What We Built

#### Backend Callback Endpoint (`/api/aws/install-account-callback`)

Created `devopshero_app/views/api.py` with the endpoint that:
- Validates Bearer token authentication
- Validates `external_id` is a proper UUID (prevents Django 500 errors)
- Finds the `AWSAccount` record by `external_id`
- Updates status to `CONNECTED` on Create, handles Update/Delete appropriately
- Returns clean JSON responses for all error cases

#### Lambda Logging Fix

Replaced `print()` statements with Python's `logging` module. `print()` in Lambda can have buffering issues and doesn't reliably appear in CloudWatch. The logging module is the recommended approach.

### ngrok for Local Testing

Enabled ngrok tunneling (`https://devopshero.ngrok.io`) so the Lambda can call our local Django server:
- Added to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
- Made OAuth redirect URI dynamic (builds from request host)

### Issues Encountered

- **UUID validation**: Passing invalid UUIDs to the endpoint caused Django 500 errors. Added explicit UUID validation before the database query.
- **WorkOS trailing slash**: WorkOS dashboard rejects redirect URIs with trailing slashes.

## 2025-12-26 - AWS Infrastructure Setup for Cross-Account Access

### Summary

Today we built the AWS infrastructure that allows DevOpsHero to connect to customer AWS accounts. The system uses CloudFormation to create IAM roles in customer accounts, with a callback mechanism to automatically notify DevOpsHero when a customer completes the setup.

### What We Built

#### 1. Install Callback Lambda (`cf_install_callback_lambda.json` + `install_callback_lambda.py`)

We created a Lambda function that acts as a CloudFormation Custom Resource handler. When a customer deploys our CloudFormation template in their AWS account, this Lambda is automatically invoked to notify the DevOpsHero backend.

**Why:** Without this callback, customers would have to manually provide their AWS Account ID after deploying the stack, and we'd have no confirmation the deployment actually succeeded. The callback automates this—CloudFormation itself tells us the deployment completed and provides the account ID and Role ARN directly.

#### 2. S3 Buckets (`cf_public_bucket.json` + `cf_private_bucket.json`)

We created two S3 buckets:

- **devopshero-public**: Hosts the customer-facing CloudFormation template (`cf_install_template.json`). Must be public so AWS Console can fetch it via the quick-create URL.
- **devopshero-private**: Stores the Lambda code zip file. Private because it contains internal implementation details.

Both buckets have versioning enabled for rollback capability.

#### 3. Customer Install Template (`cf_install_template.json`)

The CloudFormation template that customers deploy in their AWS accounts. It creates:
- An IAM role with `AdministratorAccess` that DevOpsHero can assume
- A custom resource that calls our callback Lambda

**Security:** Uses an `ExternalId` parameter to prevent confused deputy attacks. Each customer gets a unique ExternalId stored in our database.

#### 4. Deployment Scripts

- `run_devops_deployment.sh`: Master script that deploys all infrastructure in the correct order
- `upload_s3_files.sh`: Uploads Lambda code and install template to S3
- `update_install_callback_lambda.sh`: Quick script to update just the Lambda code

### Technical Decisions

**Why separate the Lambda code into a .py file?**
Originally the Python code was embedded in the CloudFormation template using `ZipFile`. Extracting it to `install_callback_lambda.py` makes the code easier to read, edit, and test. The tradeoff is we now need S3 to host the zip file.

**Why two buckets instead of one?**
Security principle of least privilege. The public bucket only contains the install template (which customers need to see anyway). The Lambda code stays private.

**Chicken-and-egg problem:**
The Lambda needs its code in S3, but S3 must exist first. We solved this by ordering the deployment script:
1. Create buckets
2. Upload files to S3
3. Deploy Lambda

### Issues We Encountered

1. **Invalid RetentionInDays**: CloudWatch Logs only accepts specific values (1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 365, 400, 545, 731, etc.). We tried 768, had to change to 731.

2. **ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state**: When a CloudFormation stack fails during creation, it enters this state and cannot be updated—only deleted. Added delete-and-wait logic to the deployment script.

### TODO

- ~~Implement the backend API endpoint `/api/aws/account-callback` to receive Lambda callbacks~~ ✅ Done (2025-12-27)
- Add error handling in the callback Lambda for network failures (retries?)
- Consider adding SNS notifications for failed stack deployments
- Test the full flow end-to-end with a real CloudFormation deployment
- Add CloudWatch alarms for Lambda errors (WE ARE MISSING CUSTOMERS!!!!)
- Document the customer onboarding flow
- Reduce IAM permissions from AdministratorAccess to least-privilege (later, once we know exactly what's needed)
- Rearchitecture DOH infra stack to use nested stacks, while solving the chicken and egg problem between S3 and 
  lambda code by keeping the private bucket in its own independent stack.
